# 1D-Modified-Laplacian-of-Gaussian-Filter-for-Smoothing-and-Denoising-
%	1D Modified Laplacian of Gaussian (MLOG).
%   [Gaussian_1D_2_Diff_Modified]=MLOG(sigma,N) returns the 1-D Modified Laplacian of Gaussian Mask.
%   "Automatic arrival time detection for earthquakes based on Modified Laplacian of Gaussian filter", in Computers and Geosciences journal. 
%   This filter is a denoising filter which can deal with several types of signals.

%
%	OUTPUT VARIABLES
%	Gaussian_1D_2_Diff_Modified :  The Cofficients of MLOG (Mask)
%
%   COMMENTS:
%   If you need to reach any equation in the paper rather than the final equation, 
%   you can change the name of the output in this function

%   EXAMPLE:
%   N = 10; sigma = 2.5;
%   [Gaussian_1D_2_Diff_Modified]=MLOG(sigma,N);
